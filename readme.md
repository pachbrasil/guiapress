# This is a repository for my lesson learning.
# I am learning node.js right now, and this repository 
# is the coding of the 2 lesson, on Udemy.
# I can say that, this course made me understand many knowlegde.
# Before I start, I didn't know almost nothing 
# Even system routing, controllers, models, views.
# I stopped programmin for 15 years, so these names are really new for me.
# But Everyday, I am learning more and more.
# Even the simple Bootstrap, I feel so usefull, don't know why some front-enders
# are complaing about that.
# It's being a happy time for me learning async system.
# Hope that I still gonna enjoy for more coding here. Github is new for me too.
# If you're watching me writing. Thank you.  Any comments, please leave some follow.
# (req, res)=> { Thank you; };

# Before starting to program. First you need to star the NPM to get the json's files, and all directories by default.
# Here is the command:
npm init
