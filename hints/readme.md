Its for me 

Need to add here some important issues about Folders and "/".
When we need to use: 
      "/" + "folder"
      "./" + "folder"
      "folder"

that's all for now.

# Lets start here:
## For VIEWS:     "folder1/.../viewFile"


## Special EJS command:
### for print use <%= %>
### for print in html format <%- %>
